    This is the privacy statement of <a
      href="https://fredbolder.github.io/portfolio/" target="_blank">https://fredbolder.github.io/portfolio/</a>, so it is not valid for
    the external links that are on my site or in my dance magazine.

  <h2>What information I collect and why</h2>
  <p>
    I collect only information that is needed to provide a good service to you.<br><br>
    The following information is collected when you buy something through my site:

    When you use PayPal to buy something, there might be more information collected by PayPal, but
    not by me. If you buy through Amazon, I have no interaction and collect nothing.

    Normally I do not share the information, but depending on your request there might be an exception.
    When you use PayPal to buy something, the information is shared with PayPal. I do not sell your personal
    information.
